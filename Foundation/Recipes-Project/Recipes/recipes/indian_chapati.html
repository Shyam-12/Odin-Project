        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Mix flours and salt in a large bowl. Use a wooden spoon to stir in water and olive oil. Mix until a soft, elastic dough forms and add more water, if needed. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Divide dough into 10 equal portions, or less if you want larger chapatis. Roll each piece into a ball and let rest for a few minutes.</p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Heat a lightly greased skillet over medium heat.</p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Use a rolling pin to roll dough balls out on a lightly floured surface until very thin, like a tortilla.</p>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>When the skillet starts to smoke, place a chapati in it. Cook until bottom has brown spots, about 30 seconds, then flip and cook 30 seconds more. Repeat to cook remaining chapatis.</p>
